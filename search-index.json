Whether that's applying a new philosophy to how I look at relationships or a new method to approach the work at hand.\n* Solution\nTry this hybrid approach.\n** While reading on the move or immersed.\nJust =highlight= and mark things on my reMarkable and nothing else. Trust the highlights.\n** End of reading session.\nEither near or at the end of the transportation, or before bed when I have spare time.\nOpen my phone (or laptop if at hand), take a few minutes to jot down about what =resonates, challenges or connects= to me.

Do not =criticise= them and their opinions.\n\nAs soon as you step into the mindset that \"I am right\", the focus of the discussion would shift from \"what's right\" to, trying to convince and make the other person realize that they're wrong. It'll be very easy to then argue for the sake of winning. To show superiority.\n* We only start to dislike someone because we choose to do so\nOne might think that it's because of a certain action that the person does/did causes us to dislike them. But truly, the choice to dislike them begins from within. It is when we deliberately =choose= to want to dislike them, we start to find their \"flaws\".\n\nFor example, one may start to find everything their partner does to be irritating. Whether that's snoring, the way they dress, their scent, etc. It never mattered until the point when one began to find these \"flaws\" as reasons to escape from the relationship.\n\nYou can always find reasons to dislike someone, no matter how \"good\" they are.\n","file":"20251105T203249--the-courage-to-be-disliked__book_philosophy_social.html"},{"title":"Types of notes","content":"#+title:      Types of notes\n#+date:       [2025-11-05 Wed 15:51]\n#+filetags:   :notetaking:\n#+identifier: 20251105T155141\n\n* Reference video\n[[https://youtu.be/R5KE3TcbwVI][Trapped in Notion's Second Brain - Nathan Laundry]]\n* The idea from Nathan\nHe talks about having two types of notes for his note taking method.\n** Processing Notes\nThese are notes that serves the purpose of =processing= thoughts or ideas, to explore things through writing (or typing). These are often temporary and can be fully discarded afterwards, since they possess little to no value once it's done.\n** State Notes\nNathan refers these as notes that records the =state= of his home lab machines. So for example, what kind of system is used in a certain machine and what software has been implemented and configured.\n\nHe also said that these are not limited to technical things. It can be for things like the \"state\" of a certain project you're working on. These are useful to keep track of things and review your progress, etc.\n* Simplifying and adapting the idea in my way\nI think it would be easier to simply refer to the two types as either =temporary= or =permanent=.\n** Temporary Notes\nThese are notes can be seen as the =scarffolding=.\n\nTemporary notes as the name suggests, are temporary. They should be able to be discarded without losing any information. Think of it almost like an inbox for things that will be either refiled or discarded.\n\nThis will mainly consists of notes like:\n+ Fleeting ideas, which will be expanded to a =permanant= note(s).\n+ Process notes (as mentioned above), where you use writing or typing as a method to de-tangle your thoughts for clarification.\n+ Temporary actions or tasks (shopping items, chores, etc) that doesn't contribute to your knowledge.\n+ Scratchpad, or brain dump. A place to just put things down without any pressure.\n** Permanent Notes\nThese are notes that should be stored for future reference, to be reviewed.\n\nA note will be counted as permanent if it contains information that are useful for later. Where we will have a purpose of looking back on it to regain information or knowledge.\n\nThese can be but obviously not limited to:\n+ Distilled information or knowledge for learning purpose.\n+ References (could be links to websites, articles or book quotes).\n+ Progress or state tracking of things (as mentioned above).\n","file":"20251105T155141--types-of-notes__notetaking.html"},{"title":"Rust Tips","content":"#+title:      Rust Tips\n#+date:       [2025-11-03 Mon 20:41]\n#+filetags:   :programming:rust:\n#+identifier: 20251103T204144\n* Good practice for =main.rs=\n[[denote:20251103T163026::#h:3ce72a10-12af-434f-9e21-7eb7fb57d9c6][2025-11-03::Good practice]]\n","file":"20251103T204144--rust-tips__programming_rust.html"},{"title":"Tomato Project","content":"#+title:      Tomato Project\n#+date:       [2025-11-03 Mon 15:37]\n#+filetags:   :ai:learning:programming:project:\n#+identifier: 20251103T153737\n* Using AI (Claude Code)\n** How to use AI as a mentor rather than a code generator\n*** Use AI to assist planning phase, heavily\n**** Ask questions like\n+ Help me break down this feature into steps\n+ What data structure should I use or consider for this?\n+ What are the trade-offs between approach A and B?\n*** Write code yourself\nSounds very counter-intuitive but the point is to not rely AI on =writing code=.\nInstead, ask AI to:\n+ Review your code\n+ Explain the errors and problems\n+ Explain what you don't understand\n=DO NOT=:\n+ Use AI to implement a feature\n+ Copy and paste solutions and suggestion =without understanding=\n*** Learning-focused workflow\n1.

What if I don't know or want to draw a tree.\n\nThat's not a problem, at least not the one that we're trying to solve here. I'm simply giving you a subject matter and the rest of the creativity is all yours. A tree doesn't have to be just a tree, it could be a tree with human features, a tree that's in a specific manga style, etc. Or it can just be, a tree.\n** Choice overload\nMost of the time, the problem is not how to draw more often. But rather, what to draw. So the solution would be to eliminate that friction by predetermine the subject matter.\n* Draw/doodle when your eyes are free\nDoodle things when you are doing things that doesn't require your full attention.\n\nFor example, when you're watching something that's not as important or is full of dialogue. Something like listening to a podcast, travelling on a bus or train.\n* Use reference but with a purpose/goal\nInstead of just using reference to copy, think about what you'd like to work on specifically first.\nIs it for 1 to 1 likeness? Line weight variation practice? Shading and lighting?\nAsk yourself the question first before mindlessly copying the piece trying to replicate it exactly.\n* Reference / inspiration\nI was inspired by watching one of [[https://www.youtube.com/@brokendraw/videos][@brokendraw's]] video on YouTube, which I unfortunately can't recall the exact one. However, I do =highly= recommend you to check out his channel and watch any video you find interesting.

But the problem is it takes a huge amount of time and effort.\n** Mnemonic approach\nInstead of studying and draw from reference. If you already know how to draw a dog, use that as a starting point.

I will be covering my personal experience with E-Ink note taking devices, in particular, reMarkable 2, Supernote Nomad and reMarkable Paper Pro Move.\n\n#+hugo: more\n* Past experience\n*** reMarkable 2\nThe reMarkable 2 is where this all started. It was my first ever reMarkable, as well as my first e-ink writing device. I have owned a basic Kindle before but I considered that to be a different category.\n**** The goods\n***** Writing feel\nThe writing feel was nothing short of pleasing. It was indeed like writing on paper, with a pencil. At least that's how I remembered it to be. It was one of those things that just got me hooked without me realising at first. I could only appreciate it after I got to try a different device (Supernote Nomad). It was like I could just write on it all day and still be just as satisfied at the end as when I started. The friction was enough to feel like I wasn't writing on glass or an electronic device. It did what it was supposed to, a pen and paper replacement.\n\nThere's one thing that I didn't really get to experiment throughout my \"[[denote:20251006T113755::#h:81d1cde0-27e4-458f-91e5-2afca12e13bd][trial period]]\". I didn't know how long the pen tips would have to be replaced before it's not comfortable to write with. This is simply due to the fact that I haven't had the need to replace it throughout my 2+ months of usage. And that wasn't just reading and writing occasionally, I was also using it as a sketchpad for drawing and sketching. Which was just as good of an experience as writing. Even after considering the fact that it only had black, white and greys in between. It would qualify as my sketchpad for sure, speaking as an artist ( who studied art and design ).\n***** Device build\nThe build quality reminds me of Apple devices, which says more than enough. The device was bigger than I would prefer ( which I have only realised after the introduction of Paper Pro Move ), but it was thin and light enough to carry around and use with ease.\n\nThe thinness of the device meant that I could write towards the edge of the device without feeling like the bezel is in the way of my palm. It felt like a stack of paper. It was also considerably lightweight, where carrying in my bag/backpack didn't feel like a burden the same a laptop would make you feel. I always had to stop and think if I needed to carry my laptop around just because it adds a significant amount of weight. This would not be ideal since I'd want to use my digital notebook almost everything where like you would with a physical notepad.\n***** UI/UX\nI have to say, I didn't feel like I was satisfied with the amount of features that reMarkable devices provide. I still question it sometimes even after switching back from Supernote to reMarkable. However, I do think that if you treat it like a sort of \"enhanced\" paper notebook, then what it provides is more than enough. At least when compared to pen and paper. I am not going to disagree with people who thinks that it just hasn't got any \"advanced\" features that other brands have, because I do feel the same at times.\n\nFor example, I don't think having a \"linking\" feature would add any \"distraction\" ( many reMarkable users like to joke and say a certain feature would be too much of a distraction for reMarkable to add ) and will benefit many users. I would love to be able to create links between different pages on my Bullet Journal for quickly switching from daily to monthly pages. This will eliminate the need for externally created PDF templates.\n\nNavigating around the device requires very little effort in learning, and is relatively easy and sensible in my opinion. I can comfortably use the device and navigate around just fine after a few minutes of trial and error. You discover things as you use the device, and they are not confusing or un-intuitive in any way. There will be small things that you won't realise at first, or until someone else mentions it. For example, I had no clue you could swipe to navigate between folders and swipe up in a document for a quick page slider.\n\nOverall, I would be confident in saying that the device is easy to use and anyone can probably get on with most of the features in a matter of a few minutes. You will learn some more \"tucked away\" feature as you use the device but that is not a bad thing. Although I will have to say there are features that I wish they would have implemented or at least plan to have in the future updates. I will mention this in the later section regarding [[denote:20251006T113755::#h:881178a1-08e9-463f-8b91-1d06b01955e8][the bads]].\n***** Battery\nIt has been a while since I've own the device as this point in time (2025), but as far as I can recall, the battery wasn't an issue for me. I do have to mention that I didn't use it as extensively as \"heavy\" users would. My usage consisted of taking notes throughout the day, reading books while travelling and sketching every now and then.\n***** Trial\n:PROPERTIES:\n:CUSTOM_ID: h:81d1cde0-27e4-458f-91e5-2afca12e13bd\n:END:\nThe general 100 days \"trial period\" reMarkable offers is one of those things that I think other companies should copy. This probably comes at a cost for the company, but as a user, this was one of the deciding factors for my purchase. If it didn't come with such a generous return window, I may not have end up purchasing the device (and gone down this rabbit hole).\n\nI've recently just learnt that they have changed the return windows for the new Paper Pro Move, from 100 days to 50 days. I cannot complain as it is still more than most of the competition, however, still quite sad that they had to make such change.\n**** The bads\n:PROPERTIES:\n:CUSTOM_ID: h:881178a1-08e9-463f-8b91-1d06b01955e8\n:END:\n***** Magnets\nThis was one of the main reasons for returning the device and look elsewhere. ( I ended up getting the Supernote Nomad in between this and the Paper Pro Move )\n\nThe problem was that the magnets inside the device itself somehow interferes with writing, which would cause the \"ink\" to wrap at certain areas on the screen.\nWhile there are temporary fixes like swiping the reMarkable stylus on the back of device to \"de-magnetise\" it, nothing actually fixed the problem permanently. I would have to do this often enough that it led me to return the device eventually.\n***** Limitations\nWhile the company pride itself of making the device distraction-free, it can be arguably seen as feature-lacking.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do love that the device cannot do everything and it's the main reason I went back to reMarkable after extensive usage with my Supernote Nomad. The fact that there's no notifications, extra applications and not being an Android device with access to APK's that you can side load, is what I appreciate and agree with as distraction-free.\n\nHowever, as you may have heard from complaints from many users, there are features that some would even consider to be essential. Now, everyone has their own definition of what's essential. The point isn't to implement *everything* people want, but show that feed-backs are taken seriously. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't feel like enough software improvements has been made since I left reMarkable for Supernote. Although I'd give them some credit for implement a hand-written note search feature, discredited for placing it behind a pay wall (which I recently found that the monthly fee will be increased by 30% as of 2025-11-20).\n***** Size\nThis is a personal preference rather than a product inferiority. I often find myself to not take the device with me simply because I do not want to carry a backpack or bag. I wanted to use the device for on-the-go scenarios, such as while travelling on transport or out for a walk. This isn't a problem if you already can't leave the house with a bag. I'm more of a sling bag/side bag everyday carry kind of person, so it is not 100% ideal in my case.\n\nTo give the credit for the company, reMarkable 2 is made incredibly well hardware wise. It is almost \"paper-thin\" and unbelievably lightweight. The device was probably designed for desktop usage, which I don't think is a \"bad\" thing. But this is my *personal* experience so I get to decide what's good or bad for me.\n* Current experience\n** reMarkable Paper Pro Move\nI have had the reMarkable Paper Pro Move for over 2 months now, and for the most part I'm very happy with the device.\n*** Why did I go for the Move?\nAfter returning my reMarkable 2, I had convinced myself that I just needed a smaller device to help me boost my \"productivity\". So I bought the Supernote Nomad. I'm not going to sugar coat anything here - it did not do that for me. At least not for very long after the excitement of a new tech product wore off.\n\nIt was more of a reading device than a notebook for me. The decline of usage time went down linearly and I will share with you what may have been the causes.\n**** The writing feel\nI didn't think that the physical writing feel would have so much weight on this, after all, I did use iPad's (with paper-like screen protectors) quite heavily before these e-ink devices. I guess it's completely reasonable that the writing feel of a \"digital notebook\" would play an important factor in whether or not one would use it extensively.\n\nSimply put, the Nomad's screen surface has always felt like there's too much friction, not a pleasant one. It was like there's a layer of \"stickiness\" that I can't get rid of. Before you say anything about, \"Have you tried using this or that?\", yes I have. I've tried almost everything mentioned by users and I'm starting to believe that it's just a personal preference thing. I have even tried with a different pen with a different nib (Lamy and it's PC/EL tips), which wasn't an ideal \"fix\" in my opinion because I do love the idea of a forever-lasting nib and weighty fountain pen body.\n**** The software\nI have always appreciate the feature set that Supernote products offered, it was one of those things that drew me to it in the first place. I still miss the ability to personalise my device, from changing the screensaver image to changing the functions for different gestures. While these are not so much a necessity, and I can live without them, they are definitely better to have than without.\n\nWhat I miss the most and believe that reMarkable should seriously consider implementing, is ways to *link* things together. Whether that's linking two pages or files, we should be able to jump between two pre-defined places easily. I get that the device is meant to be as close to paper as possible, but certain things are not replicable and shouldn't be treated the same way as physical paper. We cannot flip through pages with swipe gestures as easily as physical sheets. Not only does it take a noticeably longer amount of time and effort to filter through notebooks and find what you need, it also breaks the *flow*. And I think flow is very important when you're focusing on the task at hand. The same way that I do not want to distracted by notifications when I'm actively focusing on whatever is being worked on.\n\nNow, you might be wondering. \"Then why did you deliberately go for something that has less feature and make things more difficult for yourself?\"\n\nSimplicity.\n\nThroughout using different devices, I've come to appreciate things that are simple. Simple not in the sense that it lacks functions, but those that does what it's meant to do, very well. And reMarkable devices is the closest that I can find to this. It lets you write notes and organise them almost the same way as physical notebooks. You have all the pens and tools you'll need, that are created to a great standard. I do not like the pens on Supernote, maybe it's because I have terrible hand writing. But I should be able to enjoy the process of writing, with as little friction as possible.\n\nA good set of pens and surface that's satisfying to write on, is pretty much 90% of what I needed in the first place. The question here really, is, what do you want the \"digital\" side of things to do for you?\n\nMy answer is, there is actually not much else I need that won't distract me from just writing and reading. I don't need the ability to have an entire app store for thousands of apps that I do not need. I don't need to have different customizable toggles if the default is not in the way. I don't need any of the fancy stuff that doesn't help me in doing what I want to do. Which is to write more and read more.\n\nSo if anyone were to ask me about what device would be the best for them. I suggest you ask yourself what you *really* want first. What is it that you aim to do with this digital e-ink tablet? Now this can be applied to almost everything else that you may be desiring for, but that's another topic on its own. (Never the less, it's a great question to ask before you make any impulsive purchases!)\n**** Promised updates\nI am a Linux user for I think a few years now. I am so happy about the recent blooming of the Linux community. Without going into a different topic here, I just wanted to mention that I was excited when I saw that Linux support was in the plan for Supernote devices. That with other pro-customer \"features/promises\" had great influence on my purchase decision. I love that it was made to be repairable, that the device will be supported and maintained for a long time. \n\nA lot of these are probably still true, some of them weren't as good as it seemed to be.\n\nThe Linux development is now nowhere to be seen. Instead, they're working on a curated app store, which is probably essentially just a bunch of Android apps that are optimised for their devices. I'm not saying that the features are not welcoming or bad, it is just not heading in the direction that I was hoping for. The updates are far and few, with not many being exciting or useful to me personally. I would have loved to see new and better pen tools, interface optimisation and other refinements. I am sure that many other users do find their updates to be what they wanted, but I just can't remember the last update that brought significant improvements.\n\nThis is not to say that Supernotes aren't providing good updates, I think they do push out meaningful bug fixes and updates. In some way even better than reMarkable with their AI export, Slack support, etc. It's just that they're not making a big enough difference to keep me using their devices.\n*** What I have enjoyed so far\n**** Pocket-ability\nI didn't think I would prefer a device that's tall and long. I guess it would've made sense to me instantly if I was already into journaling traditionally with physical paper notebooks. The reduction in size meant that I could fit them into (some of) my pockets, including pants and not just jackets or coats. I do tend to carry around a sling or other type of bags while I'm out and about, but this difference meant that I can literally just carry it around with me *all the time*. I can bring it with me to the toilet, to a grocery run, to anywhere that I might have left my bag elsewhere. It unlocked more freedom to read and write on the go, which meant that I now have even less excused not to read and write.\n\nYou may argue that it's not small enough to be truly portable and not big enough to be actually productive. I would like to say that it strikes a great balance. It's small enough for many pockets, but not too small that it's limiting and uncomfortable to write on. It's big enough that I can do almost everything I want to do. Of course, if you want to use it for specific things like annotating PDF's, then it isn't what you are looking for. However, I don't think it's the device's or the designer's fault but rather that you just have a different need and it's unfortunately not suitable.\n**** Writing and drawing is pleasant\nArguably the most important boxes to tick for a digital notebook. I much prefer the writing feel of reMarkable devices to Supernote's. Although it's slightly less satisfying than I remembered with reMarkable 2, I have nothing to complain. My worries against USI (Universal Stylus Initiative) that they decided to go with, instead of staying with EMR, was gone the moment I was able to write and test the device. There were not delays or warping of any sort. To be honest, I had little to no expectations in this regard but I was so relieved and happy. I'm glad that they are able to figure something out that works this well, as I've had the impression that EMR is the superior technology and industry leading standard here. \n\nBeing good in terms of hardware is not enough to make it great. I would say that reMarkable has done a great job with the software pens / tools. All of them felt like it was carefully fine tuned to work like the real thing. Pencil has a great sensitivity curve, I am able to get the right shade and size I want just as a real pencil. The ball point pen is great for doodling and sketching randomly things, which I love doing. The brush pen, when you get the hang of it, honestly does actually feel like a real brush pen (minus the difference in brush tip of course). My favourite for writing almost everything, is the calligraphy pen. Dare I say, my handwriting looks decently legible with it!\n**** Everything just works\nI have been following the reMarkable sub-Reddit, reading all the complaints and defects that people face with their devices. Particularly the Paper Pro line of products. I was worried that I would have to return them due to similar issues. However, I am happy to report that I haven't personally experienced any of them. No yellowing of screen, dimness or ghosting (except for a single instance that was probably due to some bug). I don't doubt those that have issues with their device and are vocal about it. But I do think that most people who are happy about their device, just don't really bother to post anything. So if you do see the amount of reported defective products, I'd say take them with a grain of salt. The return policy as well as warranty gives me a peace of mind, so let's just enjoy our tools and what they have to offer.\n*** Things that I wish were better\n**** Battery life\nThe battery life experience has been such a ride of up and down. I have to say that it started real *terrible*. I was barely able to get through a day of light usage when I first received the device. Up until I opted in for beta and updated to, I believe 3.23.0.x, I was considering to return the device and questioning my choice. I would end up with less than 10-20% on a day where I barely even wrote anything on the device. The battery would then go on to drain abnormally during sleep, with WiFi being off. It was just not usable, I don't expect it to have the same battery life as my iPhone 12 mini that I used to own. It threw me off as I've never experienced this with e-ink devices and didn't expect to do so.\n\nLuckily, this has mostly been fixed through 3.23.x updates, which was made available for public users. However, I still do wish that it was slightly better.\n\nI am able to make it last a week or more under certain conditions. The conditions being that:\n1. I don't use it heavily to write long notes throughout the day. Just notes here and there.\n2. No updates or heavy syncing.\n3. The back-light isn't on full blast the whole time. Mid level lighting at night when it's required is not a problem.\n4. Not a lot of colour usage. Which means no heavy usage of highlighters and coloured brushes. This would often leave me having to charge the device at the end of the day, because I mostly use colours when I'm drawing or doing longer form of writing and highlighting.\n\nI would say that this is a weekly-charging device, but they do advertise it as having 2 weeks of battery life. Hence I'm expecting to have more usage.\n**** Features and updates\nAfter receiving this device, I started my journey in building my own version of [[https://bulletjournal.com/][Bullet Journal]]. If you didn't know already and is interesting in journaling, I recommend you have a quick read on what it is about. I would not exaggerate it and say that it's life-changing, as there's likely no such a thing in my believe. It was however, one of those things that I think will benefit me even if I don't end up using it in the future.\n\nWhat I want to say is that I wish there is ways to link things together on reMarkable devices. I want to be able to add a form of link, whether it's a button or text, to jump between pages on a note. For example, I find myself having to go from \"month logs\" to \"daily logs\" quite often when I'm trying to recall what has happened on a certain day.\n\nThe current way of doing this is very cumbersome:\n1. Swipe up from bottom to show the page slider.\n2. Slide to the page I want, which is very finicky. ( I had to design my daily pages to have a big heading showing the date and such so I can see it at a glance )\n3. Remember ( or try to ) what I've written.\n4. Write down what I want to write.\n\nAt this point, I would sometimes either not able to recall everything, or having to repeat the process to recall something else. It may not sound like such a inconvenience I'm making it to be, but please keep in mind the nature of e-ink display technology and it's responsiveness.\n\nAs for updates, I simply wish there's better updates as a whole. But I'll give it some more time as the device is relatively new and they have at least managed to solve the battery issue and introduced new templates specifically for it.\n**** Pricing\nI wanted to defend reMarkable because it is like no other device on the market as of right now. They have managed to create something that I think stand out from everything else. The form factor, the display technology, the minimalistic design and distraction-free approach. Everything combined to make this device feel different than everything else.\n\n£439 (for just the device and base marker) is expensive none the less. Not everyone can justify the price for what it can do and provide for the user. It worked for me because I value portability over many of the shortcomings. There just isn't another device on the market that I can take with as freely, while also providing a great writing experience.\n* The conclusion\nAfter trying all three devices, the reMarkable Paper Pro Move remains my preferred choice.\n\n+ My journey: reMarkable 2 → Supernote Nomad → Paper Pro Move. Each device taught me what I truly value.\n\n+ *What matters most:* Writing feel and portability. The Paper Pro Move delivers both. It fits in my pocket, feels great to write on, and keeps me focused without unnecessary features.\n\n+ *The trade-offs:* I sacrificed Supernote's rich feature set for simplicity. No customization, no linking between pages, no (proper) Linux support. But in return, I got a device that does one thing exceptionally well - *being a digital notebook that feels like paper*.\n\n+ So if you are deciding between these devices, I would suggest:\n  + *reMarkable 2* - Work mostly at a desk, want the best writing feel without size constraints\n  + *Supernote Nomad* - Value features and customization, don't mind compromising on writing feel\n  + *Paper Pro Move* - Portability is essential, want a focused, distraction-free writing experience\n\n** My bottom line\nThe Paper Pro Move works for me because 90% of what I need is a great pen and paper feel. The remaining 10% (linking, better updates) would be nice, but not at the cost of simplicity. At £439, it's expensive, but there's no comparable alternative for truly pocket-portable e-ink writing.\n\nI highly suggest that you sit down with a piece of paper and ask yourself what you really want from a digital notebook before choosing. Think about what you truly value when it comes to such a device. Is it the writing feel? Or is it a certain feature/function that you cannot live without? Try not to make the list too long because it's very likely that there isn't a device that will satisfy all your needs. After all, I still consider this category to be quite a niche one. So you may end up having to sacrifice a few things in exchange for the must-haves like I do.\n\nWhat's matters the most is that the device brings you value through actual usage. No point of having a great device that doesn't get used for it's intended purposes.
